## Quotes & notes

> P. C. Hodgell said: “That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.”

If something is not true we should destroy it. We shouldn't shun trying to destroy it. We shouldn't feel bad about trying to destroy it. If it's not true, if it's a lie, if it's false, it should be our duty to kill it. Just because we're trying to be rid of something (which is usually a negative position) we shouldn't not destroy it because of the negative perception of destruction. Seek the truth and, in doing so, you will annihilate that which is not true. By discovering the truth you prove that which is not true, false.
